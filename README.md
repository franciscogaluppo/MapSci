# Reseach Space

"Here we use a large dataset of scholarly publications disambiguated at the individual level to create a map of science — or research space — where links connect pairs of fields based on the probability that an individual has published in both of them."

"Here we introduce a new approach to generate scientific knowledge maps based on a machine learning approach that, starting from the observed publication patterns of authors, generates an N-dimensional space where it is possible to measure the similarity or distance between different research topics and knowledge domains."
